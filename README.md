# DCGAN with PyTorch and Tkinter

This project is an implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) using PyTorch. It includes a Tkinter-based interface for setting the training parameters.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary libraries.
3. put .lang file for your language in the folder with gui.py
4. Run the script and enter the training parameters in the Tkinter window that opens.
5. Click "Start" to begin training.

## Installation

Install the necessary libraries using the following commands:

**1** For all systems --> ```pip install nvidia-cudnn-cu12 pillow```

**2.1** For Linuxㅤㅤ--> ```pip install torch torchvision```

**2.2** For Windows --> ```pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121```
